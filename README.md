## Contributing (code)
This is more of a hobby project than an actively maintained project, I have limited time to review and respond to issues so response time can be long.

If you want to contribute code to this repository, please start by opening an issue and explaining what you have in mind and why. If I think it sounds like a good idea I can add you to contributors and let you open a PR. 

As memory is very limited on a watchface (especially on older devices) new features must meet a high bar:
- Useful for a large number of users
- Implemented in a performant and memory efficient manner
- Not in the way for existing users, if it changes how it looks it should probably be optional
- Fits in well with the aesthetics of the watch face

For refactorings and optimizations keep in mind that:
- I value my own understanding of the codebase, refactorings reduce this understanding and must outweigh the loss in other benefits
- Optimizations must include profiler results and memory useage
- Both optimizations and refactorings require significant testing across all supported devices

 ## Things people have asked for (may or may not be implemented)
- Goal completion marker
- Pressure trend
- Monthly run/bike distance
- Notifications as icon
- Line font for bottom fields
- clock font without segments
- separate 24h mode for alt tz

- OWM: Fix remaining weather data fields with fallbacks
- YR?
- OWM: check if hourly forecast cached values work
- OWM: error handling. What happens when no network, wrong api key etc.
